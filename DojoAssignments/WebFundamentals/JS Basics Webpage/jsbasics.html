    <h2> JavaScript Basics </h2>
    <p id="content"> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scrpiting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
      It is a small lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives
      inside a host of environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

          <p class="underlined_text">Variable Declaration</p> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds
          the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be
          identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <p class="bluetext"> var x;</p>
        </p> </li>
        <li> <p>
          <p class="underlined_text">Variable Assignment</p> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
          giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to the variable. <p class="bluetext">var x = 10;</p>
        </p> </li>
        <li> <p>
          <p class="underlined_text">Data Types</p> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
          that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <p class="bluetext"> true</p> or <p class="bluetext">false;</p>null - <p class="bluetext">null</p> aka nothing;
          Number - <p class="bluetext">42</p>or<p class="bluetext">3.14159;</p> String - <p class="bluetext">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</p>
          Array - <p class="bluetext">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</p> and Object - <p class="bluetext">{first_name:'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</p>
        </p> </li>
        <li> <p>
          <p class="underlined_text">Conditionals</p> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values
          or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following  conditional statements: <p class="bluetext">if</p> a specified
          condition is true, do this code in our code block;<p class="bluetext"> else if</p> to specify a new condition to test, if the
            first condition is false; <p class="bluetext">else</p> we execute this block of code;
          </thead>
        </p> </li>
        <li> <p>
          <p class="underlined_text">Loops</p> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
          an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
        </p> </li>
        <li> <p>
          <p class="underlined_text">Function</p> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example
          imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done!
          We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.
